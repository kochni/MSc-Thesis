This Directory should contain all files needed to compile your
work at home. However, you will not get the newest versions of
the definitions (files.sty). So if something works at ETH, but
not at home, you probably have to get the latest .sty.

** Generate files of different format:
 - .pdf: press Ctrl+c Ctrl+c then type latex PDF in emacs (minibuffer)

*** not really recommended anymore:
  - .dvi: press Ctrl+c Ctrl+c then type latex in emacs (minibuffer)
  - .ps: press Ctrl+c Ctrl+c then type print in emacs (minibuffer).
          choose ps as printer

** Don't forget to spell-check your text 
   (for example in emacs: Tools -> Spell Checking)

** Do generate *.pdf graphics files in R --> see ./Pictures/picture.R
** Otherwise: (This is only needed if you got .eps from somewhere!)
   Convert your .eps graphs in .pdf: in the terminal, type 
   eps2pdf *.eps
